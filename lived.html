		<h2>Lived Experiences Project Draft<h2>
		<p>What is statistics? Different people give different answers.  
		A college student whose major is not mathematics, natural science, 
		or engineering related, might say that statistics is a study of 
		means of summarizing collections of data, or just a study of data. 
		A natural science major student, such as a biology student, might 
		give us a more interesting definition: “Statistics is a relative 
		of mathematics.  Although statistics and mathematics are kin, 
		looking closely we see differences in their DNA.”  </p>
		
		<p>It is not necessary to argue which definition is better, since 
		statistics is related to, and applied to, many fields of study.  
		I believe statistics is either a science studying data and uncertainty 
		theoretically, or a tool to solve problems from many fields by helping 
		us correctly collect and interpret data. Although I am officially 
		a double major in economics and mathematics, I consider myself a 
		student of statistics. </p>
