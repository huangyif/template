		<p>What is statistics? Different people give different answers.
		A college student whose major is not mathematics, natural science,
		or engineering related, might say that statistics is a study of
		means of summarizing collections of data, or just a study of data. 
		A natural science major student, such as a biology student, might
		give us a more interesting definition: “Statistics is a relative 
		of mathematics.  Although statistics and mathematics are kin, 
		looking closely we see differences in their DNA.”    </p>
		
		<p>In fact, we do not need to argue which definition is better, 
		since statistics is related to, and applied to, many fields of 
		study.  I believe statistics is either a science studying data 
		and uncertainty theoretically, or a tool to solve problems from many 
		fields by helping us correctly collect and interpret data. Although I 
		am officially a double major in economics and mathematics, I consider 
		myself a student of statistics.  </p>
		
		<p>Like almost every kids, I love video games. Coincidentally, the story 
		between me and Statistics starts with video games. Almost 10 years ago, 
		I came across a soccer video game called Football Manager.  It is a 
		series of soccer management simulation games based on a massive 
		database of real-world players and clubs from around the world, in 
		which you play as the head coach or manager dealing with tactics, 
		transfers, trainings, soccer games, media, etc. Playing the game 
		is just as in the real world, every unremarkable change is possibly 
		associated with the success or failure of your “career”. Let me give 
		you some examples, a right comment made to your players during halftime 
		can change the result of the game significantly, but a wrong plan of 
		training will injure your players before the game. In addition to your 
		team’s performance, you also have to maintain good relations with either 
		fans of club or your colleagues and players, to keep your job as a manager. 
		If you are doing well, you will receive offers form more famous club with 
		higher salaries, or even the honor to serve for your country – the national 
		team. I bought almost every year’s version of this game as almost every
		team’s roster changes a lot. What made me so interested in this game is
		its precise simulation of ten thousand players from about 50 countries. 
		Also, this game taught me one thing that elements (or variables in 
		mathematical sense) from different fields have something to do with each 
		other. This game has even been recognized by many real-life soccer clubs 
		as a credible means of scouting opponents and players. Being a soccer fan 
		and playing Football Manager is basically how I became interested in 
		statistics, although I knew little about the science behind the video game. </p>
		
		<p>As a soccer fan, I frequently browse the Internet for soccer related 
		news or programs. In 2009, I watched a sports program reviewing the best
		10 goals of all time in the FIFA World Cup.  One of those goals was scored 
		by Argentina against Serbia-Montenegro at the group stage of the 2006 FIFA
		World Cup. The offensive was launched by Argentina’s defender after an 
		excellent tackle and the goal was finished, after 26 consecutive perfect 
		passes between 8 players, from Argentina's backfield to Serbia-Montenegro’s 
		penalty area, by Esteban Cambiasso. I remembered that this spectacular goal
		was described by the television host as the best goal scored ever in the 
		history of FIFA World Cup. In order to emphasize the significance of the 
		goal, the host stated that the goal had even become a subject of statistical
		research at university. The host’s comment really impressed me, since at that
		time I was, like other high school graduates, facing the choice of college major.
		Doing research on soccer in a scientific way seems to be very interesting for me.
		I did some Internet searching for more information about the research mentioned 
		by the host. Luckily, I found a research publication on Argentina’s soccer team 
		in the 2006 World Cup, A Potential Function Approach to the Flow of Play in 
		Soccer, by David R. Brillinger, a professor of Statistics at University of California,
		Berkeley. Although scientific terminology and complicated mathematical expressions
		constituted a huge barrier between me and the research, and even today the whole 
		research is still beyond the extent of my knowledge, I was impressed by some of 
		the context noted by Professor Brillinger. In the abstract, Professor Brillinger
		mentioned that the result of the research is a potential function which can be 
		used for prediction, simulation, or other research regarding a soccer team’s 
		playing. The abstract surprised and confused me.  Surprisingly, I saw an answer 
		to how Football Manager might simulate soccer games so closely.  What confused me
		was how things like team chemistry could be quantified and then interpreted as 
		function.  Based on my knowledge then, it seemed that only numerable or at 
		least measurable subjects can be quantified, for example, en average SAT scores,
		or miles per gallon of gas used by an automobile. Things like team chemistry, 
		or players’ performance by instincts or experience, seemed impossible to 
		measure via data analysis. But, I also had another idea: If the technology 
		of interpreting various things by data does work, learning it will enable me 
		to get a job in a variety of fields. With that thought, I applied to college 
		with a major of statistics.  </p>
		
		<p> In my freshman year, I started with fundamental math courses like calculus 
		and I also kept looking for courses covering knowledge similar to that used in 
		Professor Brillinger’s research. Thanks to Professor Brillinger’s putting some 
		keywords of his research in the front page, I can trace some of the rationale 
		by terms like exploratory data analysis and regression model. Unfortunately, 
		related courses provided by Department of Statistics are graduate level, for 
		instance, STT 863 Statistical Methods I, which even has a graduate level course 
		as its prerequisite. Although I had already decided to apply to graduate school, 
		I was still somewhat disappointed to know the courses enrollment constraints.  </p>
		
	
		<p>You never know what’s coming for you.  Due to my desire to become an Associate 
		of the Society of Actuaries, last fall semester I took an Economics course taught 
		by Professor Tim Vogelsang, to fulfill the requirement “validation by educational
		experience of economics. Unlike other undergraduate economics courses, which are 
		dominated by theoretical knowledge without any mathematics and statistics involved, 
		this course introduces a statistical method called econometrics. Since the 
		econometrics model uses the principles of a regression model, the econometrics 
		courses was a very desirable way for me to approach gaining greater knowledge of 
		statistics.  Taking the course also got me more interested in studying Economics. 
		As the course progressed, I began to know that, unlike in the period of Adam Smith, 
		today’s study of Economics requires plenty of quantitative analysis. Therefore, many 
		contemporary economists have extremely strong mathematical and statistical backgrounds.
		The Department of Economics at Michigan State University provides a good example: 
		Professor Tim Vogelsang, the Frederick S. Addy Distinguished Professor of Economics,
		majored in Mathematics at MIT, and Professor Gary Solon, previously serving as
		department chair at University of Michigan, was statistics major undergraduate student 
		at Harvard. </p>
		
		<p>In addition, after consulting with advisor of Department of Economics, I understood 
		that being an economics major student allows me more opportunities of taking statistical
		related courses, within the range of 120 credits. So, I changed my major to economics, 
		and now I enjoy learning statistics from a broader perspective. </p>

		<p>the purpose of the video</p>
        <p>The purpose of the video is for Randy Roberts Potts to reads his letter to his uncle
		   Ronnie.</p>
		   
		<p>how the video attempts achieve its purpose</p>
        <p>The video includes two parts: written words and Randy's narrative of the letter. The
		   written words give a general information about uncle Ronnie. Randy’s narrative is more
		   of his personal emotion.</p>
		   
		<p>the structure of the message</p>
        <p>The structure of the message is basically a story with the chronology.</p>
		   
		<p>how this video's structure can help you revise your Lived Experiences project</p>
        <p>This video's structure give me an idea about revising my Lived Experiences project. 
		   From this video, I can see that there is a significant difference between a general 
		   essay and a narrative form. Therefore, I should express things vividly and sometime
		   with emotion, just like describing a picture.
