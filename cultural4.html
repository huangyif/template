			<h1>Description of Issue</h1>
			<p>The internet provides more freedom of speech for Chinese citizens 
			living in China than do other, older communication mediums.  Unlike in
			the United States or in other western countries, social networks like 
			Weibo, which can be thought of as a “Chinese Twitter”, play a unique 
			and special role in China’s society. Internet users in China have been 
			becoming an important force to move forward the nation. As Jon Huntsman, 
			Jr – the 16th Governor of Utah and 9th United States Ambassador to China – 
			stated, 500 million Internet users and 80 million bloggers in China make
			Internet an very important source to understand this country. First of all, 
			Weibo (“Chinese Twitter”) serves as an effective system of reporting 
			corruption among government officials. According to the Xin Hua Net, 
			the official press agency of Chinese government, most of officials who
			have been dismissed and prosecuted due to corruption were exposed by Weibo 
			users. Since the judicial system in China is still under development, many 
			corruption cases in local government might not be able to refer to disciplinary 
			authorities. Weibo, in some cases, can make reports of corruption noticed more 
			rapidly. Persons who makes such reports post names and clues of officials’ 
			suspected misconducts. Then, their posts are noticed and reposted eagerly 
			by many users, including celebrities such as rock stars, movie stars and 
			Chief Executive Officers of big companies. When people repost information, 
			they always comment on it. Information about the suspected corruption or 
			misconduct spreads by a so-called “Network Effect”, which prompts various
			media such as newspapers, web portals, and TV stations to expedite reports
			to investigate the truth. In order to follow public opinion, related disciplinary
			organizations investigate the alleged corruption more quickly than they would otherwise.</p>
			
			<p> One corruption scandal, noticed in the Western media, is about Lei Zhengfu, former 
			district secretary of Chongqing Municipality of southwest China. According to Xin Hua 
			News Agency, in November 2012, a sex video was posted online that then spread on Weibo 
			at an unimaginable rate. Lei Zhengfu was soon recognized as the man in the video. On 
			investigation, it was found that Lei Zhengfu was lured into having sex with women and 
			was secretly recorded doing so by a real estate developer. The real estate developer 
			either blackmailed or offered a bribe to Lei Zhengfu in order to win the bid on a 
			development project. After two trials, Lei Zhengfu was sentenced to 13-years imprisonment
			for bribery.</p>
			
			<p> In addition, Weibo has been a milestone of improvement in superintendence of the Chinese 
			media. In the United States, the freedom of the press is protected by the First Amendment to 
			the United States Constitution. Based on the press freedom statement of the United States 
			Department of State, freedom to express various points of view is a key component for an accountable
			governance. A mature system of press can watch over governmental action and over the machinery of justice. 
			In China, media, like newspapers and television stations, have been traditionally inclined towards
			making comments conservatively, since news content in newspaper and on television is strictly
			regulated. However, on Weibo, editors and correspondents from those traditional media can report news
			and make comments with greater freedom.  </p>
			
			<p>This freedom provides many benefits, but also provides some risks and negative consequences.  
			The current gang-rape trial of a Chinese general’s son provides an example. According to Chris 
			Buckley from The New York Times, in February 2013, one adult and four teenagers raped a woman in 
			a hotel room, after getting her drunk at a night club. The case caught a great deal of attention 
			because of the family background of one of the five defendants – 17 years old Li Tianyi. Li Tianyi
			was born to a high-profile family. His father Li Shuangjiang holds the rank of general in China’s 
			People’s Liberation Army. His mother Meng Ge is a prominent singer in the China’s People’s Liberation
			Army. As the only child from a wealthy and privileged family, Li Tianyi has a record of illegally driving
			a BMW and wounding people with intent. </p>
			
			<p>The public were very much concerned about whether Li Tianyi’s trial would be fair. To echo the call of 
			public opinion, the procuratorate opened an account on Weibo and released information on process, as much
			as they could, and responded to questions from media and legal professions. As Jonathan Kaiman
			from The Guardian stated, “Li Tianyi was the second most-read topic on Sina Weibo”. The court
			also kept Li Tianyi’s trial and verdict updated via Weibo. Finally, Li Tianyi was sentenced
			to 10 years in prison, the strictest punishment possible for an adolescent convicted of 
			gang-rape. </p>
			
			<p>As an exotic and new field, the internet in China is less regulated by law and censorship. 
			As a result of the ease of restrictions of speech on the internet, social networks like Weibo are 
			regarded as a catalyst for democratization. Either business corporations or government-related 
			institutions are under superintendence of the public. People from all sectors of the community 
			can exchange their ideas and can even express points of view directly to the authorities.  </p>
			
			<p>However, less regulation on the Internet does not always make Weibo beneficial to Chinese 
			society. Sometimes even injustices and lawlessness are connived. For example, people’s privacy 
			might be invaded. According to Xin Hua News Agency, earlier in 2013, information posted on Weibo 
			and reposted a thousand times within a couple of days revealed that Li Yunqing, a retired senior
			engineer in Guangzhou City, was suspected of corruption. The reason for suspicion was that Li 
			Yunqing and her son owns 24 houses. However, the investigation by disciplinary authorities in 
			Guangzhou City indicated that she was neither a government official nor a member of the Chinese 
			Communist Party. The investigation also confirmed that Li’s family became rich solely through hard 
			work and a legal investment strategy. In this case, the lack of regulation on the Internet did harm 
			to innocent people, as Li’s family’s information was leaked and spread without any permission. 
			Even in the criminal case of the Chinese general’s son, Li Tianyi, social networks like Weibo
			became places of wrongdoing. The 58th article of the Law of the People’s Republic of China on 
			Protection of Minors states: “In the event of a case on a crime committed by a minor, news reports, 
			films or radio programs, public publications, or websites, etc. shall not disclose the minor’s name, 
			domicile, photos, images, and other materials from which the minor might be deduced.” This law is
			relatively strictly obeyed by traditional media, such as newspaper and television stations. 
			However, on the internet, especially on Weibo, an enormous amount of information about the 
			17 years old adolescent was released. Not only his name but also his photo was made known by the 
			public. He went to school at Shattuck-St Mary’s in the United States. He was witnessed driving a
			BMW without a driving license and caused a traffic accident. Although he was a suspect who 
			involved in a gang-rape case, he is also a minor. Rude exposure of his personal information not only 
			cannot help the investigation but also violates his rights as an adolescent. Exposing information 
			in Li’s case due to public wrath made Li partially not protected under the law.  </p>
