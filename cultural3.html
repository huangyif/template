			<h1>Analysis of Artifact</h1>
			<p>However, today’s social networks are more than tools to promote 
			communications between people all around the world.  Consider the 
			applications of social networking that can be operated on various 
			portable devices, such as smartphones and tablets. Their capability 
			of disseminating information far exceeds that of newspapers, television,
			or even websites. One significant example of this capability is Twitter’s 
			effects on stock market.  As a tool allowing instant sharing of information,
			Twitter is able to affect investors’ decisions significantly. On August 13, 2013 
			Apple’s stock price surged by 5 percentage -gaining about 17 billion in market 
			value – after billionaire Car Icahn made an announcement related to Apple on Twitter.
			Although it cannot be proved to be a causal effect, it is undeniable that the two events 
			are correlated. Statisticians at Indiana University, School of Informatics and Computing, 
			published a research paper – Twitter mood predicts the stock market – and gave a result 
			demonstrating a correlation between Tweeter comments and stock market movement.  
			Behavioral economics, individual are not rational as a consumer. Decisions made
			by individuals are always affected by cognitive biases, no matter how smart 
			the individuals may be. </p>
