			<h1>Remix Project Assessment Memo</h1>
		
		<p>
		For the Multimedia Remix Project, our group selected Yaolei Shi’s “Cultural Analysis Proposal.” The theme of Shi’s paper was the benefits of, and the importance of, taking risks. In order to revise Shi’s written paper and then develop it into a documentary, we needed to consider that, in a documentary, audiences will expect to see less text and more visual materials. Selecting proper visual substitutes for some of Shi’s original written material was important. We also needed to consider that, since a documentary is not organized by paragraphs, and a documentary is not broken into paragraphs but should show some analogous separation of separate ideas, we would need to consider the structure of the documentary.
		</p>
		
		
		<p>
		In class, we watched a documentary about recent medical breakthroughs and extraterrestrial knowledge. This inspired us to create a documentary in narrative form with pictures and other visual materials. Although in a narrative style documentary there would be more opportunities to tell written stories, simply repeating text in Shi’s paper was not enough.  
		</p>
		
		
		<p>
		Organizing materials for our documentary required everyone fully understand Shi’s paper. As a result, at the beginning of our work, we spent a lot of time discussing the paper and asking Shi questions, to ensure that our documentary would be coherent and well-organized. Since Shi’s paper lists several examples of successful risk-taking persons, each of our group members, expect Shi, were put in charge of making a video clip for one of Shi’s successful risk takers.  I elected to create a video clip of Christopher Columbus’s story and to highlight his contribution, via taking risks, to the world.

		In this assignment, working well with all group members was important. Personally, I believe that working in groups for this documentary was fruitful.  I expected this, as, while a novel can be, and usually is, written by one author, but a movie generally requires the effort and collaboration of a large group of professionals with different specialties. In our case, we did not each have different professional knowledge related to documentary production. On the contrary, when all of us had prepared our materials, we noticed that no one had any experience that would enable him or her to turn all our materials into a video with pictures, voice, subtitles, and background music. If this documentary assignment was an individual work, probably most students would have felt very frustrated completing such a project, without prior expertise, in three weeks. Together we created and edited our documentary in 4 hours. If we were given more time, I probably will conduct interviews with professor in Arts & Letters Department.

		In my opinion, the most effective aspect of our documentary was the background music. We listened to many different possibilities before selecting background music from a video game – Uncharted Waters Online. Uncharted Waters Online is a massively multiplayer online role-playing game set in the Age of Exploration. And, we believe these music worked well as the background music in our documentary.
