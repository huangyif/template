			<h1>Anticipated Effects</h1>
			<p>Social networking can either improve or impede the development of China. 
			Although wrongdoings like fabricating facts and slandering people are within 
			the scope of application of the criminal law, the current Criminal Law in China 
			does not provide a clear idea about how to administer punishment for Internet cases.
			Article 246 of the Criminal Law of the People’s Republic of China stated: “Whoever, 
			by means of violence or by other means, insults in public another person for fabricates
			facts to slander another person shall, if the circumstances are serious, be sentenced
			to fixed-term imprisonment of not more than three years, criminal detention, public 
			surveillance or deprivation of political rights.” Since there is no previous case about
			“serious circumstances” of internet wrongdoing, a discussion has ensued about how to 
			apply criminal law to Internet wrongdoings. Every individual has the right to express
			his or her opinion on other individual. Sometimes, a sports fan might post insulting 
			words regarding players of his host team solely because of the team’s terrible performance.
			Should a case like that be considered a serious circumstance of slandering? In order to 
			respond to the public concern, the Supreme Court and Supreme Procuratorate made an official
			statement that gives several definitions of “serious circumstances” on the internet. 
			For example, a slandering post which is reposted more than 500 times or has more than 
			5000 hits is considered “serious”. A post that cause insanity or suicide of victims 
			or their relatives is considered “serious”. Although these definitions are at a tentative
			stage, it is very important to prevent the internet from hurting individuals, while 
			maintaining social networking’s merit as a place of expressing and exchanging ideas 
			and opinions.</p>
