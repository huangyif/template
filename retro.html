			<p>
			Before taking this course, I thought a WRA course would be solely focused on writing papers. As the course went on, I saw that I actually was learning more than I had expected. The purpose of this Course Retrospective Project is to review what we learned completing the different projects in our WRA class.
		    </p>
			
			
			<p>
			The Lived Experiences Project was the first assignment in WRA 110 and, also, my first writing assignment in college.  The style of the Lived Experiences Project was narrative, that is, the assignment was to tell a story.  Writing a story about yourself seems ‘doable’ for students regardless of prior experience or future major, and so was a good choice for the subject of a first assignment.  A story about me and about a piece of technology related to my major did not need to refer to materials from either formal or informal sources. This was a relief as following APA or MLA style seemed difficult at the time.  Although this first writing assignment was not a formal academic research paper, it gave me an opportunity to practice college writing. The word requirement for this assignment was 1,200 words, about four pages in “double-spaced” format.  
			</p>
			
			
			<p>
			Generally, telling a story is not difficult. However, presenting a story in written form and trying to guarantee every reader can understand a story is not easy. The first assignment helped students to practice coherent writing. 
			</p>
			
			
			<p>
			Before completing the first assignment, we watched a video in class. The video was about a young man, Randy Roberts Potts, who reads a letter to his gay uncle, Ronnie. This was a typical narrative video and gave me a rough idea about the style of a narrative paper. 
			</p>
			
			
			<p>
			The second assignment was the Cultural Analysis Proposal. The second project required more formal writing than the first one.  We needed to use, and reference, materials according to either MLA or APA guidelines, and to include a ‘Works Cited/Referenced’ page.  The assignment was to research a social issue by researching and analyzing a cultural artifact.  
			</p>
			
			
			<p>
			As one of our class activities, we watched the movie The Social Network in class. This movie actually inspired my second paper.  Social networks, on the surface, are tools to promote communications between people all around the world.  However, along with the Internet, social networks had an unexpected impact on society, an impact beyond even what was expected by the builder.   The Social Network inspired me to write about Chinese social networks’ impact on China’s freedom of speech. 
			</p>
			
			
			<p>
			In fact, the assignment attached to The Social Network was more important to me and, I suspect, to other students, than the work done for the course thus far, because the other work done at that point was, in format, very close to the format of papers we knew we would write in concurrent and future college courses.  For example, I am currently taking CHS 360, Cinematic Studies of China, Hong Kong and Taiwan. There are two writing assignments in this course. Each assignment requires us to write an analytical essay on a specific topic in, or related to, the movies watched in class.  The “movie study” assignment in CHS 360 required students to write essays focused on probing key issues in cultural studies rather than summarizing the movies’ plots. That is to say, retelling the story of a movie was not enough for the assignment.  Since I had, at the time the movie study was assigned, already completed the assignment related to The Social Network, writing the movie study was relatively easy.
			</p>

			Our third assignment was to write a formal research report.  In class, Dr. Daniels gave us a Library Activity Exercise to help us to differentiate between general (popular) writing and scholarly (formal research) writing.  One property of scholarly writing is its audience. Materials in a popular article, such as an article in a magazine, possibly can be understood by most readers, regardless of their professional background or prior knowledge. However, unlike a popular article, an academic article is written by scholars to present their ideas and understanding to people in their field.  The author generally assumes that his or her audience already shares a lot of background knowledge from within their academic discipline. It is possible for an academic article to be full of jargon and complicated mathematical expressions without detailed introduction of either.  In addition, in order to share ideas with peers, the author needs to publish their article. A publication should follow the academic style/format strictly. 
			</p>
			
			
			<p>
			In the third assignment, the most important thing was to understand a scholarly article we selected and read, and to then summarize the article’s content while following APA or MLA standards.  We also read an article from a ‘trade publication’ devoted to the field for which our scholarly article was written.  We used information in the trade publication article to give the reader a sense of what it would be like to work in the field for which our scholarly was written.  The article was to be selected from our likely future discipline, an excellent idea as the assignment thus provided undergraduates with a chance to learn more about their future discipline.  We also conducted two interviews – one with a person teaching courses in our prospective future discipline, the other with a person who is working in a field close to that discipline.  The interviews gave me a broad set of facts and opinions about my chosen discipline, which helped me to select an academic article to write about from the several articles I had initially selected and read. 
			</p>
			
			
			<p>
			Although at MSU a formal research paper is not required for most undergraduate courses, practicing and understanding how to write a scholarly article is very important. Most undergraduate programs require students to, before graduating, complete a research course within their major academic discipline. For example, every economics major needs to complete EC499, Senior Seminar for Economics Majors, a course in which students present research projects on one economics topics. It is particularly important for students who plan to pursue a Masters degree, or even a Ph.D. to learn writing skills. 
			</p>
			
			
			<p>
			I am currently working on the fourth assignment for WRA 110, the Multimedia Remix Proposal. This assignment is a fundamentally different writing task than is writing a paper of any sort on my own. It entails collaborating with three other students in the course.  And, for this assignment, we need to create a documentary based on the revision of one of our previous projects. 
			</p>
			
			
			<p>
			Working in a group is common in college and in career life.  Working on the Multimedia Remix Proposal, I learned a lot about how to cooperate with colleagues to make the team work efficiently on solving a difficult problem. That it would have been hard to complete the assignment on my own brought home the value of working with a team.  
			</p>
			
			
			<p>
			Working on the Remix Proposal also underscored that writing is not the only way to present and share ideas.  Indeed, a novel and a movie about the same story can coexist. Neither can ever be replaced completely with the other. In some cases, the audience will ‘get’ the story more efficiently and more easily if one format is used instead of another format.  Because of this, the Multimedia Remix Proposal was very valuable, as it improved my skill at presenting information via video.
			</p>
			
			
			<p>
			In addition to practicing writing, in WRA 110 I have been learning how to create and manage a small website.  Every week we have one assignment on Codecademy, and every one of those assignments has been entirely about learning coding.  I would guess that coding in HTML, as required for the Codecademy assignments, was difficult for students who did not have any HTML experience before taking this course.  However, Codeacademy assignments were a good opportunity to learn and practice web programming, knowledge of which is useful for many people’s future careers.  
			</p>
			
			
			<p>
			At the beginning of the semester, and in the first assignment, I learned some basic coding skills, such as how to create page titles for and place paragraphs in my online portfolio. In October, for our second project, the Cultural Analysis Proposal, I was challenged to build a website. In that task, we were required to provide a fully-functioning web page consisting of multiple pages. It was a little difficult to connect each page to the others, even though I had a template given to us by Dr. Daniels. After interconnecting the pages I felt like I had mastered a fundamental website-building skill. 
			</p>
			
			
			<p>
			I did learn a lot from this course. Perhaps, as an international student, I sometimes faced more pressure than native students, because English is not my first language. But I believe the course’s workload was reasonable. And I am glad that I wrote my first formal research paper in this class. 
			</p>
			
			
			<p>
			Personally, my favorite part of this course was its organization, because each task improved my communication and presentation skills in different ways, and built on what was learned in the preceding assignments. Given the many benefits it offers to students, the first-year WRA course will help a student to succeed in college.
