			<h1>Introduction</h1>
			<p>The internet is doubtless one of the greatest inventions in 
			human history. In August 1962, the concept of “Galactic Network” 
			was propounded by J.C.R. Licklider, a computer scientist at Massachusetts
			Institute of Technology. Like James Watts’ invention of the steam engine,
			which prompted communications between countries on different continents, 
			the internet has revolutionized almost every field of industry. With the 
			rapid development of communications technology, the internet has become an 
			important part of work and life.</p>
			
			<p>In fact, almost everything in people’s lives is now connected to the 
			internet. A typical college student’s life is a good example of this phenomena.
			At universities, the internet is used to make education more efficient. Student
			course materials can be distributed and organized much more easily. Submission 
			of student projects or homework need not be restricted to class hours. If a student
			is busy with his or her work, he or she can take online courses at home or anywhere 
			else at a more comfortable time.  </p>
			
			<p>For a college student, time spent on social networks like Facebook makes up the 
			largest part of his or her time spent on the Internet. According to statistics reported 
			by Facebook, there are 1.1 billion users who visit Facebook actively each month. 
			48 percent of 18-34 year olds check Facebook when they wake up, and people in that 
			demographic spend, on average, 20 minutes on Facebook each visit. In fact, social 
			networks like Facebook, Google Plus, and Twitter change people’s lifestyles enormously. 
			An active Facebook user’s rough autobiography can easily be assembled solely by visiting 
			his profile site. Making friends is also much easier than ever before. By clicking on the 
			request a friend button, one can even make friends who do not speak the same language. </p>
